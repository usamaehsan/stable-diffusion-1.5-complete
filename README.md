# üçå Stable Diffusion 1.5 COMPLETE on Banana

This repo gives a basic framework for serving Stable Diffusion 1.5 in production using simple HTTP servers.

My plan is to include stable-diffusion text2img, img2img, and inpainting in this repo so that every bananese (banana user) uses same public template for sd 1.5, which means no 10-20 second cold boot cost (For now only available txt2img with negative prompt and multiple schedulers).
